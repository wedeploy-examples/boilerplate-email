# WeDeploy Email / JavaScript Boilerplate

This example will guide you through the process of deploying a WeDeploy Email container.

> We assume that you already have the [WeDeploy CLI](https://github.com/wedeploy/cli) installed and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) is running.

> [Visit this guide](#) if you need help setting that up.
